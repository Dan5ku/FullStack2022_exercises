1.React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

2.Components are independent and reusable bits of code. 
They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

3.A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, 
instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages.

4.Declarative programming is a method to abstract away the control flow for logic required for software to perform an action, 
and instead involves stating what the task or desired outcome is.

5.JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. 
JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript

6.Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, which means it doesn’t block further execution while one or more operations are in progress.
